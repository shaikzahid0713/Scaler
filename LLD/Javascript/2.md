## Functions in JavaScript
- First Class Citizen
- A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A  function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```javascript
// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function Call
console.log(sum(4, 5)); // Prints 9
```


## Function as Expressions
Functions can be
- Assigned as a Variable
- Passed as a parameter
- Returned from another function



### Assigned as a Variable
```javascript
//  Function assignment as Variable
let subract = function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}
```


### Passed as a Parameter

```javascript

```


### Returned From Another Function

```javascript
// Return Subract Function from minus Function

function subract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}


let minus = function(x, y) {
    return subract(x, y);   // Return Subract Function
}

console.log(minus(5, 4));
```


## Code Execution in JavaScript
Execution Context
- Global Execution Context
    - It is created when JS file execution is started
    - GEC is destroyed when a JS file execution is completed.
- Function Execution Context
    - FEC is created when a function is called.
    - Before FEC is destroyed, the value is assigned to the variable from which it is called.

Code Execution is done in two phases
- Memory Allocation
- Code Execution

### Memory Allocation
- Memory is allocated but values are assigned with **Undefined** Value
- Existence is acknowledged but value is not
- Function gets its entire body 


### Code Execution
- Values are assigned to Variables
- Program is executed.

### Call Stack



## Hoisting
The feature where variable and functions are accessed before they are declared is called **Hoisting**. 
- Variables - Undefined
- Function - Full body hoisted

```javascript
var message = "Hello"; // 1

function greet() {
    console.log(`${message} from Greet`); // Hello from Greet
}


console.log(message); // 2
greet(); // 3

/*
Output:- 
    Hello
    Hello from Greet
*/
```


Hoisting is done after the memory allocation phase is completed.

```javascript
console.log(message); // Undefined
var message = "Hello"; // 1

function greet() {
    console.log(`${message} from Greet`); // Hello from Greet
}


greet(); // 3

/*
Output:- 
    Undefined
    Hello from Greet
*/
```


Hoisting considers the entire body of a fuction 

```javascript
console.log(message); // Undefined
var message = "Hello"; // 1

greet(); // 2
function greet() {
    console.log(`${message} from Greet`); // Hello from Greet
}



/*
Output:- 
    Undefined
    Hello from Greet
*/
```

Here, Even if the function is called before declaration, the code provides the same output after declaring it.


### Temporal Dead Zone
Hoisting does not work with let/const. The values for these types are unavailable till you reach them. This phenomenon is known as Temporal Dead Zone

```javascript
console.log(message); // Value Unavailable
let message = "Hello";  

/*
Output:- 
    Reference Error
*/
```
