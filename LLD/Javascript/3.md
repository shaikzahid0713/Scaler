# [Agenda](../Javascript/3.js)
* Lexical Scopes
* Closures


## Lexical Scopes
- Defines access of data
- All Children will have access to their parent variables.
- Top - down heirarchy
- Chain that forms from Grand-Child -> Child -> Parent is called  **Scope Chain**
- **Lexical Environment** -> Local Memory + Environment of Parent
- In JS, Child Function 'remembers' the environment it was created, hence it can access it's parent's environment
- Even if parent function has finished executing, the child still has access to its variables via **Closures**
- Let & Const are Block Scoped
- Var is Function Scoped

## Closures
- It allows access to parent function's data, even when the parent function's code execution environment is destroyed.
